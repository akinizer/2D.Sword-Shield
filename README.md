#### Project Description
---


Sword and Shield is a two dimensional top-down strategy game inspired from Bloons: Tower Defense. The game is intended for two players: the attacker and the defender. The map will consist of a base for attack units to spawn, a lane for them to walk and a lot of space for defense units to be located. There will be offensive and defensive units to be used during two different stages of the game. At the first stage, defensive player will buy and put his desired items on the map. During the second stage, attacker player will try to breach through the end of the map by spawning attack units in a limited time.
